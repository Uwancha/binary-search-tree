# Binary Search Tree

This project implements a Binary Search Tree data structure in JavaScript. It includes modules for creating a binary search tree, performing operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and tree traversal.

## Project Description

The Binary Search Tree project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum for learning full-stack web development. It provides a hands-on experience with implementing a fundamental data structure and understanding its operations.

The project consists of three modules:

- `Node`: Represents a single node in the binary search tree.
- `Tree`: Provides methods for constructing and manipulating the binary search tree.
- `Driver`: Demonstrates the usage of the `Tree` module by creating a tree, performing operations, and displaying the results.

## Getting Started

To use the Binary Search Tree module in your JavaScript project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Include the `Node.js`, `Tree.js`, and `Driver.js` files in your project.
3. Make sure to import the required modules in your code.
4. Use the provided functions and methods to create, modify, and traverse the binary search tree.

## Usage

To create a binary search tree and perform various operations, modify the `Driver.js` file. The existing code demonstrates the usage of the tree module by:

1. Generating a random array of values.
2. Creating a binary search tree from the array.
3. Performing operations like checking balance, level-order traversal, and tree traversal.
4. Inserting additional values into the tree.
5. Deleting a specific value from the tree.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different operations on the binary search tree.
